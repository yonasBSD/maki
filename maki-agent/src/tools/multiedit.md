Make multiple find-and-replace edits to a single file atomically. Prefer this over edit when making multiple changes to the same file. Read the file first to get exact content.

old_string must match the file contents exactly, including all whitespace and indentation. Each edit must match exactly once unless replace_all is true. Use replace_all for renaming across a file.

Edits are applied in sequence - each operates on the result of the previous. If any edit fails, none are written. Ensure earlier edits don't affect text that later edits need to find.
