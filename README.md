An AI coding agent optimized for minimal use of context tokens, while providing a great user experience.

Context efficiency:
* `index` tool - uses [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter) to parse supported programming languages to produce a high level skeleton of a file, with exact start-end lines of each item (e.g. a function's implementation is in lines 150-165). Encouraged to be used before reads. For my usage it adds 59 tok/turn but saves 224 tok/turn on read calls, saving 165 tok/turn.
* `code_execution` tool - uses [monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty) to run an interpreter that has all other tools available as async functions. Maki uses it to filter / summarize / transform / pipe data to other tools as input, without it ever reaching and polluting the context window. Sandbox limited by time & memory.
* `task` tool - when delegating work to subagents, the AI chooses whether to run weak / medium / strong model of used provider. Think haiku / sonnet / opus.
* System prompt, tool descriptions, and tool examples are all concise, I've made sure not to bloat your context.
* Uses [rtk](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) if you have it installed, disable with `--no-rtk`. Saves ~50% of bash output tokens. Remember bash is just 12% of total token usage, so 6% is nice, but saving on reads (65% of total) by using `index` gave me more benefit. I think I'll do bash output filtering like this myself in a future release.

User experience:
* SUPER fast startup, 60 FPS, and light on memory. Not running any javascript, using [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs) for TUI. Even the splash screen animation uses SIMD.
* Philosophy of not hiding anything - while other coding agents hide information as models improve (e.g. not showing number of lines read), maki leaves you in control.
* UI fits everything well on my small screen laptop.
* Full visibility of subagents - each subagent gets their own "chat window" you can easily navigate between using `/tasks` or Ctrl-N/P.
* Sensible permission system - when the agent runs `git diff && rm -rf /`, what do you think will happen in your current coding agent? It will treat it as `git *`. Maki uses tree-sitter to parse the bash command and figure out the permissions requested are `git *` and `rm *`. Disable using `--yolo`.
* SSRF protection on `webfetch` calls.
* A `memory` tool to keep long term context, just tell maki to remember something (sometimes it uses it automatically). Managed via `/memory` (view / edit / delete memories).
* Fuzzy search with Ctrl-F.
* `/btw` to run a command with the chat history without interfering with the current session.
* Rewind on Escape-Escape (no code rewind yet, only chat history).
* Attach images in prompts.
* 26 of the most popular themes.
* Resume sessions.
* Skills & MCPs.
* Plan mode.
* Run bash commands using `!`, or `!!` if you want maki to not know about it.
* `/cd` to change dir.
* Use `--print --output-format stream-json` to run UI-less. Output is compatible with Claude Code, so you can easily replace your existing solutions (although I wouldn't recommend that, maki is very new).

## MCP Servers

Configure MCP servers in `~/.config/maki/config.toml` (global) or `.maki/config.toml` (project, takes precedence).

### Local (stdio)

```toml
[mcp.filesystem]
command = ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"]

[mcp.github]
command = ["gh", "mcp-server"]
environment = { GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_xxxx" }
```

### Remote (HTTP)

```toml
[mcp.analytics]
url = "https://mcp.example.com/mcp"
headers = { Authorization = "Bearer tok123" }
```

### Options

All servers support `timeout = 30000` (ms, max 300000) and `enabled = true/false`.

Server names must be alphanumeric + hyphens and not collide with built-in tools. Tools are exposed as `<server>__<tool>`.
